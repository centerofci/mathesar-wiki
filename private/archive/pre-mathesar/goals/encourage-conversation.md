## Motivation

Partisanship and us vs. them mentalities seem to have been increasing in recent years. The internet has been making this worse in many respects by promoting bubbles/echo chambers, rewarding purveyors of outrage, and contributing to reducing people's attention spans.

My opinion is that almost everybody is well-intentioned and wants to make a better society, and most people have more in common than differences. People seem to have a hard time recognizing that, and I think our current society is creating fewer incentives for them to do so.

It would be interesting to explore technologies or platforms that could help with this.

## Questions

- What can software do to help with this?
- How do we incentivize people to use software that won't give them the same type of instant gratification?

## Challenges
- It's important to identify the real problems to solve here. Building a better discussion forum with the perfect moderation rules will not cause people to flock to it. People might be drawn to partisanship due to other underlying factors that cause them to seek out validation/a tribe, and those are the factors we need to address.
- It's difficult to create the proper incentives here; it's like asking people to improve their health by cooking food from scratch every day when they could have fast food delivered cheaply and save a bunch of time. It involves people changing habits, learning new skills, and switching from a short term to long term focus.

## Additional Thoughts
- Ben Sasse's book, [Them](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1250193680), argues that we've developed a culture of hate because people feel lost and rootless and that we need to go back to building deep roots in our real-life communities in order to get the social support we were designed to get.
