# General Advice
- Commit early, commit often.
- Write good commit messages.
- Create draft pull requests for in-progress work.
- Try to keep pull requests small if possible, since it makes review easier.

# Review Process
Please follow these guidelines when reviewing PRs.

## Authors
- Once you think your code is ready to merge, mark your draft pull request as "ready for review" or create a pull request if you don't have a draft. The required reviewers will automatically be notified when you do this.
- Please post in `#mathesar:matrix.org` and tag the Mathesar maintainers (`@blm`, `@pavish`, `@kgodey`) when you have a PR ready for review.
- If the reviewer requests changes, please make the changes and **re-request review**.
- Do not resolve comments, let the reviewer do this.

## Reviewers
- Check for outstanding PRs at the start of your day.
- Request changes if you want another look at the PR before it is merged.
- Resolve your own comments, do not resolve anyone else's.
- If you approve the PR, merge it unless someone else has requested changes.
- If the branch needs to be updated before merging (because it's out-of-date with the master branch), do so, as long as the action can be performed automatically.  Otherwise, ask the Author to handle it.
- Always merge using merge commits, never squash or rebase (the GitHub interface should disable squash and rebase, but check just in case).
