# Joi brainstorming #2 notes

**Date**: 2021-01-28  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Joi

## Recap

- Recounted who we've talked to this week

## Personal Health Dashboard
- Not much knowledge (from Joi, self-assessed) in the space.
- Extremely competitive with big players, messy
- Compared to academic stuff, fairly political but players are known and we have a good map of the battlefield
- More of a stretch, but Joi still likes it
- What can we do with open that big players cannot do
    - Can we use open source and decentralization as a foil to get around trust issues with institutions
- Joi will introduce us to a couple of people
    - Jini Kim: first product manager for Google Health, now involved with Nuna Health, one of the people involved with fixing healthcare.gov, also has personal experience with family medical issues
    - Ariel Ganz (already introduced), she works with her advisor works on integrating data from wearables and personalized medicine
    - Mustafa Suleyman, not a traditional SV ML type, working at Google on improving auth/identity management, started health at DeepMind
        - thinks the tech companies will kill OSS with the current direction
    - Donnie Bell: CMO of NYC health and hospitals
    - David Eigen: has a very clear idea of what he wants to build and will share it with you, finance oriented, hardcore, has done a lot of market research
        - Could compete with him or build something he could work with
- A lot of science and technology in the biomedical space affects architecture, adds a community that we'll need to have expertise in
- CCI has a lot of connections in this space, a big space
- Ties into other ideas - searching for research about health is crappy, should be able to say "here's my genome, how likely am I to get COVID"?
    - Interact with proprietary layers in medical ecosystem, there will be for profit players that we should play nice with
- Brent: Hard part might be bureaucratic, not technical, pulling together a few data feeds isn't that hard
- Platform could be opinion agnostic, people could build dashboard that made sense to them
- Large institutions have trust issues.  This might be a competitive advantage
- Nunahealth

## Personal Learning
- https://betalist.com/startups/sophya - Joi invested in this, they are pivoting
    - Joi will introduce us to their CEO
- Joi's sister works on informal learning networks
    - People on YouTube are having to change their content to appeal to YouTube recommendations and it's orthogonal to learning outcomes
    - Interviewing YouTube creators might be useful
    - Tap into open course developer community
    - Joi's sister can introduce us to scholars
- Studies have shown effect of amateur coursework performed better than professional content
- How can we engage teachers and authors who are learning from stuff I've written beyond just producing materials
    - Interviewing teachers might be good
- Are there people who can walk you through a matrix inversion but isn't the best lecturer ever?
    - If we can make things scalable, people are usually happy to interact with people learning 
    - Real time interaction is really valuable
- Business model: tutoring, buying 30 min of time to walk through problem or answer questions (or buy pair programming time)

## Discussion
- How many different ways are there to do various ideas, is a generalized knowledge tool possible
    - Any tool is a subculture
    - Can you create a personal learning platform?
- Are there unusual ways that people learn that haven't been developed?
    - not courses, interest driven learning
- Ed Boyden would good to talk to about open search, he consumes more papers than anyone Joi knows
    - Would be good to talk to once we have more of our ducks in a row
