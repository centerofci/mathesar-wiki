## Problem

A common issue with science reporting is the tension between making a news
article palatable to a general audience without removing so much information
that the result ends up being inaccurate.  Often, citations of the original
scientific material are missing.

## Solution

There should be a search bar where one can enter the URL of a news article, and
end up at a page with any relevant citations organized in some useful way in whatever
file format is appropriate (e.g., pdf).  This is obviously most feasible for source
material which is openly licensed.
