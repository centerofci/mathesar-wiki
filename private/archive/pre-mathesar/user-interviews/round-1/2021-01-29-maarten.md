# Maarten Zeinstra brainstorming meeting

**Date**: 2021-01-29  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Maarten

## Context
- Background about us and the Center
- https://codefor.nl/ - interesting group of people
- Maarten is working on a web crawler that indexes domain and see what open source tools and running on that
    - You need data to put open source into lobby action
    - There are some websites that track this but it's also proprietary
    - You can see classes in the CSS to see fingerprints of OSS
    - Implementation details:
        - Scraped homepage, links, headers
    - Crawling is not difficult since you only need one page, CommonCrawl is too large
- You can make it a hackathon, provide data and get people to figure out what's figure-out-able from that data

## General impressions
- If you want to have complex interventions in complex situations, you need to understand the complexity of the people working in those fields
- Some of the ideas seem like you're looking from our ivory tower and coming up with solutions
- How does the existing group of users deals with the problems you see it

## Health dashboard
- very interested in this
- very difficult
    - have to extract data from silos
    - need security and trust
    - Need to ward against just adding another silo of health data
    - "personal data vault" initiatives of folks w/ Raspberry Pi's; building boxes to hold health data.
- Quantified self movement
- One country that is miles ahead of any other country in terms of digitization
    - Estonia
    - Everyone puts their data into one repository, consequences of misusing it are very great, lose doctors license
- Maarten doesn't wonder very much about how his data is being used
- EU – harmonization in privacy laws, GDPR
    - meant for creating mobility in data
    - Data standards are probably very different
- Maarten isn't familiar with data standards relating to medical information
    - Maarten does have some contacts with open medical people in NL
- Open Nederland
    - Has some members working in open healthcare
    - One person working on open source WebMD: Markus Oei https://nl.inforium.nl/
- In Europe, you can get all your data from any organization within 6 weeks
    - There is an app for requesting your data in the Netherlands
    - Part of watchdog for privacy toolbox
    - https://www.mydatadoneright.eu/

## Open search
- To solve a really complex problem, it's peer-reviewed publications in the open publications world
- Maarten knows a professor building a site that removes financial incentives
    - https://scipost.org/
    - Physics publisher
- Take one open source intitiative that really needs professional developers and contribute there
    - SciPost qualifies
    - https://scipost-codebases.org/groups/scipost/-/issues

## Personalized learning
- Not attracted to this idea.
- Maarten has been done with professional learning for a piece of paper for a while
- Learning doesn't necessarily involve improvement of discovery
    - People who want to learn will find ways to learn
    - In Europe, university provides authority on the quality of learning and educated people
- You can't formalize the world, people have very different individual learning styles
- Persistence of learning material is a hard problem to solve
    - IPFS
    - https://persist.lu/
    - handle.net

## EasyDB
- Who are the users? Who will actually use this?
    - Start with a small community
- Likes the idea
- OpenRefine is comparable
    - new documentation just released
- Archivists are not waiting for this tool, they have enough trouble wrangling the data in their own system
    - New thing in NL for archives is an open source software that makes models for different styles of handwriting
- Europeana data model wrangling – there are tools to do this
    - easy to use as long as input is XML file with fairly flat structure
    - there are 4000-5000 museums, but most of them go through aggregators and collection management systems which handle the data
        - export functionality
    - Delphi EDM (Maarten showed screenshot)
    - Adlib, Axiell, MuseumPlus
- Museum/archive market is not a good one to break into
