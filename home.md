# Welcome
Mathesar is an open source project that aims to make databases accessible to non-technical users, allowing users to store, manipulate, visualize, and collaborate with others on their data. We're heavily inspired by [Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY).

We are in early development and hope to launch an alpha version of Mathesar by November 2021.

## About the wiki
