## Jim Geelen

**Date**: 2021-02-02  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Jim  
**Background**: Jim is a Graph Theory prof at University of Waterloo, and a potential user for the personalized learning and open search ideas.

## Ideas from Jim

These are things that have not been done very well from an academic's point of view.

- Software to prepare a handwritten talk on tablets
    - Best program on iPad, Notability
    - Drawing interface is not very good
    - More and more people are doing handwritten talks
    - Both for real time writing and for annotating PDFs
    - Notability has improved their drawing, but it's still very simple
        - Layers would be help
    - Notability can magnify text when writing, but make it smaller
    - See: http://matroidunion.org/
        - Peter Nelson does really beautiful talks, also available on YouTube
        - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2n82vzfR7M
    - Beamer looks more "professional", but people prefer handwriting
    - Would be especially useful given more online classes these days
- There's a lot of online talks in general, but there's no repository for online talks
    - arXiv used for papers, would be good to have an equivalent resource for talks
    - would be good to link back and forth between arXiv and repository of talks
    - if you're linked to arXiv, you'll get more buy-in from the academic community

## Prepared Questions
1. Do you see any specific challenges for publishing mathematics learning materials online?
    - Not too bad
    - arXiv and Matroid Union are pretty easy to publish to, but very domain specific
    - There's no repository for math blogs
    - Not too bad for Jim specifically
    - There's an online seminar announced through the Matroid Union, it's on YouTube
        - Matroid Union is very domain specific
    - A bit ad hoc at the moment
    - Jim made the course for a particular reason and put it on his website
        - It helps to be well known for that kind of thing
        - People who know about graph minors know about Jim Geelan, and go to his website
    - There are publicly run journals on top of the ArXiv
    - Advances in Combinatorics ?

1. Have you ever published learning materials online besides the videos on your homepage?
    - Has generally used his web page
    - In the old days, put a bunch of mathematically interesting stuff on the website, but no lectures
    - Releasing it publicly involves privacy issues to students
    - The original lectures were released online was in response to a specific person  needing a reference to graph minors
    - By putting it on the website, make no apologies for mistakes etc.
        - Making it more public would make it seem like a "finished product", but it's not
        - e.g. I make a mistake in one lecture and correct it in the next
        - Wouldn't be comfortable if it was very public

1. What media types are you interested in publishing as learning materials online? (y/n):
   - Video and text
   - PDF file in the background and Jim in the foreground, square in a square
       - Something that would help do that would be great
   - Currently uses Zoom
       - It takes learning to teach online
       - Big difference between interactivity in undergrads vs grad students
   - Whiteboard programs aren't too good
   - The video editing process is hard, making it easier would be appealing
       - One of the video lectures online has a note there that says "starts at 2:30" because Jim couldn't figure out how to trim the video
   - Jim can't promise he'd use better video editing tools if they existed
     
1. What scale are you interested in w.r.t. publishing online learning materials?  (I.e., a single 20-minute lecture vs. a full video lecture course vs. a curriculum that teaches you all math up to vector calculus)
    - Talks are easier than papers, get ideas out quickly
   
1. Are you interested in / offended by / indifferent to the idea of your lecture videos being included in some sort of online course aggregator or search service?  Perhaps even rehosted?
    - Indifferent
    - There's a difference between me putting something somewhere and it ending up somewhere
    - Jim putting it somewhere makes it a value judgement

1. Do you know any tools your students use for finding and accessing online learning materials?
    - No
    - Does not use online resources to supplement his own courses, philosophy is self-contained
        - Doesn't even have notes
  
1. Anything else you want to tell us?
    - Other people to contact:
        - Peter Nelson (Matroid Theory)
            - Math 249
            - Produces content more, doesn't just give lectures
