## Problem
GitHub and Gitlab make finding, exploring, and working with code very easy, even for inexperienced developers. There is no equivalent website that makes finding, exploring, and working with datasets equally easy.

## Solution
A site where you can upload datasets, explore existing datasets, convert between formats and download datasets in the format of your choice. Exploration functions would include visualizations/charts/graphs and the ability to run SQL queries from the browser.

## Competitors
See [this overview](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2020-03-06-so-you-want-git-for-data/).
- [DoltHub](https://www.dolthub.com/) is aiming to do this, but they're also pushing an entirely new version control/database system called Dolt, and it's the only thing they support. We'd work with existing formats and convert between them.
- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) does some of this as well, but they're focused on machine learning skill building and competitions. Plus they're owned by Google, and no one needs to be giving Google custody of more data.
- [Dataverse](https://dataverse.org/) is an open source project focused on self-hosted institutional data repositories. The UI is not very intuitive and it's not aimed at simplifying interacting with data.

## Challenges
- Getting people to use a new platform. The platform isn't useful unless there's data on it.
