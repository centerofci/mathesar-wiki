## Problem
There are a lot of recipes on the internet. It's difficult to find recipes that you can cook given the ingredients you already have and to get standardized metadata about recipes such as nutritional value.

## Solution
A tool that can keep track of the food you already own and use that information to find recipes that you can cook with what's in your pantry. It can also provide nutritional data for recipes based on the ingredients that are in it.

## Challenges
- Standardizing ingredients can be tricky.
- This is a cool idea, but does it offer a good enough experience over the existing way of finding recipes that it would be a sustainable project?

## Thoughts
- I (Kriti) built some of this in college for my honors project: https://github.com/kgodey/Bendakai
