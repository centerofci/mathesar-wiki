## Problem
Social media does more harm than good. Some of the flaws I see with social media:
- encourages people to have opinions when they otherwise might not
- encourages posting for other people's approval
- discourages 1:1 relationships in favor of appealing to groups (often leading to appealing to lowest common denominator)
- makes the world much smaller, which encourages people to worry about things that don't affect their life
- condenses nuanced topics into short soundbytes
- constant notifications and new posts can be addictive

## Solution
We could experiment with creating simple social media platforms with rule changes and see what kind of community develops.

One example is applying [ROBOT9000](https://blog.xkcd.com/2008/01/14/robot9000-and-xkcd-signal-attacking-noise-in-chat/) rules to the entire social media platform, so that no one can say anything that has been said before.

## Questions
- How would we measure success?
