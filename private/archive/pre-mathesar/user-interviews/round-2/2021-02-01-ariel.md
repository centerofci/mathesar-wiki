# Ariel Ganz meeting notes

**Date**: 2021-02-01  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Ariel

## Agenda
- Introduce ourselves & the project
- Learn about Ariel and her work
    - Check if Ariel works with patients/others
- Introduce Health Dashboard and go through questions

## Ariel's work
- Someone from her lab at Stanford has built a health dashboard
- Advisor (Mike Snyder) invented tools for understanding genetic effects
    - RNAseek
    - Personalized multi-omics profiling
        - your vitals are compared to "average", but the average isn't "your normal", e.g. if your normal temp. is 96.5, 98.6 is a concern
        - measuring everything about your health, wearables
            - clinical imaging, measuring metabolites and proteins, thousands of indicators about person's health
        - able to predict and prevent disease in a big way
            - compare to people's own baseline
            - 50% of people in the group had major actionable health findings
        - goal is to use both individual and group metrics
            - individual is the primary baseline
        - lot of information is not currently being used in clinics, we have the ability to predict and prevent disease way more than we currently do
        - Diabetes was one thing that was detected very early
            - Many subtypes of diabetes, reasons for getting diabetes vary
        - People are taking the wrong medication for their genome
            - this gene needs this medicine
        - Measuring stuff is not cost prohibitive, it's basic infrastructure problems
    - Personalized Health Dashboard (PHD) app, can download
        - Currently only used for detecting COVID using heart rate changes
        - heart rate over steps also works, different algorithm, testing algorithms
        - You can't put in FitBit, Oura, genome data into medical records, this is meant to change that
        - Apps can go in and access the data from PHD
        - Genome annotations isn't being shown yet, needs further development
        - Current medical records aren't comprehensive
            - Can't store new data streams from smart devices
        - App has a doctor part, and a patient part

## Wireframe/Idea Feedback
- We should focus on positive reinforcement, instead of negative
    - E.g., just show a checkmark when you've exercised instead of pointing out when you haven't
    - This should be possible for most things
    - This is a subtle thing, but good for user experience. You just want to close the app when you see it tell you that you haven't done all of these things that you wanted to do.
- A lot of people have tried to optimize health, but optimal depends on your values
    - Get rid of migraines vs. be a better runner vs. sharpest mental clarity
- Useful for Chronic Fatigue Syndrome and Chronic Lyme
    - Ariel can connect us to folks working on this
- Ariel has noticed in the last month that whenever she eats flour/wheat, she gets asthma attacks
    - Maybe due to dessicant or herbicide
    - Never would have figured it out
- Stress and HRV would be a good thing to track
- Brent: do these things generalize? Do we need to start migraines and have a bunch of clinical knowledge about that, or just have some goals and cost function generally (e.g. hit this button when this bad thing happen)
    - It seems like clinical knowledge is necessary
        - to start, initial suggestions like "drink more water" or "sleep more" for migraines
        - track really fast ways to measure whether it worked (did you get a migraine yes/no)
        - eventually from aggregated data
        - if three things cause migraines, try cutting one thing out
    - You might be able to A/B different possible solutions
    - You could combine different solutions 
- Nutrition is hard since "optimal" isn't easy to define widely; it depends on goals
- There are apps that can track mental health based on keyboard usage patterns

## Next Steps
- Ariel will connect us to a couple people in her lab, working on chronic issues and personal health dashboard
