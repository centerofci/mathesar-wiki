# Alek & Paul (Open Future) meeting

**Date**: 2021-01-27  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Alek Tarkowski, Paul Keller

## Open Future
- Think tank
- Trying to focus on earlier-stage framing of discussion around open.
- Good Strategy Bad Strategy -- book about strategy

## General Feedback
- Alek has varying levels of competence in these areas
    - First idea is most difficult to judge (EasyDB)
- How do you attach these ideas to specific existing communities, since we'll be launching something small at the beginning
    - Mentioned https://h5p.org/, started off as plugin to existing WordPress/Moodle ecosystem, very smart approach that allowed it to scale
    - H5P is a project of Christer Gunderson, involved with open in Norway
    - Digital Public Good is USAID equivalent for Norway, Christer is involved with that now
    - https://digitalpublicgoods.net/
- Alek likes global tools, although it's a reasonable strategy to focus on a specific country first
    - We should think about which of our tools are most global
- Paul: Where are we in need of open source alternative?  Zoom. (Jitsi)
- Sustainability doesn't have to come from the produt being monetized, it can come from public and institutional funding
    - European perspective is suspicious of non-publicly funded open infrastructure
    - e.g. https://www.surf.nl/en
    - How do we go back from Zoom to something more sustainable and avoid massive transfer of wealth from public to private sector?
- Is there any way to integrate with Europeana's tech community?
    - e.g. cultural heritage researchers have pressured digitization and staff acquiring new skill
- Is it possible to focus on a closed sub-group of researchers?
- Alek and Paul have connections to Europeana.
- Data quality / normalization is a persistent issue, EasyDB would be a good thing to run by them
    - Libraries move slowly

## Personalized Learning
- Data governance is a big topic in Europe
    - How to create positive flows around data rather than negative ones
    - e.g. MyData, creating middlemen who manage data rather than going to big players immediately
- Alek likes it
- Alek also has experience with education
- Personalized learning puts data in the hands of the users, Alek likes that
- Contacts based on existing network are good
- The space is promising, but not sure about the competition
- Education is behind in the open source space, questions about data and governance etc.
    - Could be an opportunity
- Curricula in K-12 are determined by teachers, it would be cool to have decentralized systems but most teachers are passive and depend on resources provided by publishers
- How do we define success here?

## Idea ranking
- Alek:  
    - Don't know enough about personal health to vote
    - EasyDB -- too abstract
        - tweak it to fit into academic field or academic software and it changes the concept
    - Thinks either the academic search or personal learning tool are best
- Paul:
    - Likes EasyDB best
    - Personalized Learning second
        - extremely crowded field, but solutions are immature
    - Open Search
        - doubtful, so many open search things have withered away
        - with that name, it's bound to fail
- Personal health
    - Data might be radioactive
    - This makes it a difficult problem to solve
    - Is the real problem to create health dashboards that are personal? Societal health metrics seems more important that personal/individual metrics.
        - Societal health data could affects policy discussions, which would be interesting
        
        
## Post-call thoughts
- How can we find a "closed network"?  Brent will make a separate doc.
