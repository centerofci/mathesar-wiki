Related to [credibility](credibility.md), [](innovate-discovery.md), and maybe [](accelerate-innovation.md).

## Problem

Nothing is created in a vacuum, but it can be difficult to determine the
context, inspiration, etc. of a given work on the internet.  In academia, this
is solved by a (usually) rigorous system of citation.  In photos (as an example
type), this is more difficult.  Similarly for music, video, and other media.

## Solution

Combine social network data, time of publication, similarity metrics, etc. to
attempt prediction of whether a given work was inspired by another (or
combination of others).  Make this graph navigable.

## Challenges
- This may be intractably difficult.
- If two songs inspired a given song, why should it be similar enough to
  either to detect?
- If we find a potential inspiration for a work, how do we know that the
  author of the downstream work was aware of the upstream?
- What's the line for "inspired by"?
    
## Thoughts
Could we solve the determination of "inspired by" with authority metrics,
combined with the assumption that the downstream artist was acting according to
some zeitgeist, and the prior work was created as part of an earlier
(inspirational) zeitgeist?  I.e., even if a downstream creator wasn't aware of
a specific upstream work, perhaps you could say that the most "authoritative"
upstream work was influential enough over the general atmosphere in which the
downstream work was created.

This is easiest, and perhaps most useful, for works published under open
licenses.

## Name

Inspired by the Pandora Genome Project, which Kriti made us aware of.  A good
version of this tool would detect that.
