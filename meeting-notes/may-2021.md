## Internship update
- Eamon is now starting on May 24.

## Hand-off design to development

### Questions
- What does design need to consider as part of the hand-off to development process? 
- How does the implementation planning process look like for design solutions? 
- How do we test and refine design solutions as part of this process? 

### Discussion
- Waiting on the entire design to be done before starting frontend developmment seems like overkill
- Pavish and Ghislaine can work in parallel
    - e.g. Pavish can start on the basic table structure while Ghislaine is defining more complex interactions
- There will always be iterative changes even after a module is developed
- There should be design review meetings to catch small issues (like selecting multiple options instead one)
    - Design reviews will be all four of us, since it impacts the backend
    - We'll use existing Mathesar check-in meetings for design reviews, it will be an agenda item
    - Ghislaine will post the link to the Figma project beforehand
- Review meetings should take care of testing/refining desigh solutions
    - Once we see it live, there will be some refinements noticed that will involve additional issues being created.

## Staging environment
- We should set up a staging environment with real data
    - Consider the team using Mathesar to keep track of project related information
        - User interview ideas
        - Non-code related todos
    - Have a large (millions of rows) database stored on staging so we can identify issues
    - Set it up on RDS or GCP equivalent so that we can make sure it works
- It would be good for all of us to have our own private instances of Mathesar as well that we use regularly

## Design Prototyping Sandbox
What environment can we create so that design interactions can be built and experienced as prototypes by the team or internal/external stakeholders.
- Would be good for Ghislaine to have access to our components so that she can design with HTML
    - Single source of truth for all styles
- Ghislaine would be building static HTML files with some javascript from existing components, there's no need to edit existing files on production
- Potential solutions
    - We could have a Storybook for components, but it wouldn't work for entire application pages
    - Ghislaine could download latest CSS from client builds

Solution: for now, just download latest CSS and apply to local HTML files
- Pavish can help Ghislaine set up a local development environment when ready

Ghislaine will match CSS class names to Figma components.

## Design Principles & Closing Design Issues
- Ghislaine is working on these on parallel with Figma designs
- We'll discuss on Friday

## Mathesar Philosophy

### Exposing DB Structure via Object View of Data
- Databases are different from spreadsheets because they're actually _less_ table oriented
    - Fundamental structure is record, everything is relationship between records
    - Tabular view is useful for some things, but is limited
- Just because databases have tables, doesn't mean we should only be focused on tables or everything needs to be a table
    - Eventually we will be able to handle non-rectangular data, Postgres can do that
- Table is the default view, but we'll support kanban, cards, calendar etc.
- Ghislaine will share paper on spreadsheet vs. record design from MIT
    - We need a record view

### Plugins
- People should be able to build their own views and types as plugins, probably more
    - Maybe aggregations or groupings, other types of data manipulations
- Too early to discuss plugin architecture in any detail
- Mathesar is a "swiss army knife" for data, people should be able to build their own set of tools, not just have a pre-configured set of tools
- We should handle reflection really well etc. to make Mathesar useful for power users 

## Routing
(Pavish demoed local Svelte-rendered Mathesar for CSV upload form)
- Currently working on table view
- Routing is handled client-side
- Need API for database name and table names in schemas
    - Kriti will work on this today
- Discussed best way to render JSON data in the Django template
    - We will switch to using serializers to get data and pass it to the template via context
    - this will also ensure that the format matches the API and allows consistency when working with the API

## Design section on wiki
(Kriti demoed work on Design section on wiki)
- Ghislaine will update wiki later with Design Principles & Design Process

# 2021-05-03

## Meetings
- Meetings are three times a week now
- We should continue to use Mondays for planning the week out + any discussion.
- Wednesdays and Fridays should be for general updates/discussion/talking through problems. ideally, we'll have an agenda in advance (nothing formal, but someone should have a topic they want to talk about or brainstorm/bounce ideas off of people) and cancel the meeting if there's nothing to talk about.
   - We're not going to cancel any meetings next week, just to see how it goes.
- We have to use the full hour, we'll end early if we're done with discussion.
- The plan is to have fewer meetings in the long term, doing things asynchronously is better for community involvement, documentation, etc.
    - It's important to have more meetings at this stage until we all fully grok the project and get to know each other better.

## Last week retrospective

### Pavish
- Set up frontend development environment and workflow - everything needed to get started with frontend
- Documentation - only updated README, see currently open PR
- Kicked off discussions for production build and E2E integration tests
    - Too early for this right now, but we should keep it in mind

### Ghislaine
- A round of wireframes for data exploration, discussions with Kriti
    - Research revealed that BI platform vs. web analytics etc. all solve similar problems differently
    - Went back to Dabble DB to look at it again with more information about what's under the hood for us
        - e.g. they don't have "tables", we want to expose more of the DB structure
        - they made different layout decisions
- Created a document: [Initial Research and Wireframing Conclusions](https://hackmd.io/@mathesar/SkyvIqKDu)

### Brent
- Moved stuff over from the prototype repo to main repo
    - Prototype used SQLAlchemy 1.3, current repo uses 1.4, which implements the "2.0 API" and deprecates a bunch of things
    - Took a while to port over, especially `copy` method, which was deprecated for being non-deterministic/imprecise, leading to unexpected behavior
        - We had to implement our own `copy` method in a simplified Mathesar Column class
- Ticketing
- Discussions
    - e.g. function signatures - Kriti & Brent were using different types of signatures, and needed to get in sync
- Moving over stuff from the prototype is done, except for Jupyter notebook and random table creation, which will not be moved over
- Put together demo for Ghislaine and Pavish
- A bunch of bug fixes

### Kriti
- Worked mainly on the API
    - Mostly done
        - CRUD on records (no PUT (not necessary))
        - Read-only on schemas and records
- Did work on testing
    - Django
    - CSV uploading
    - API
- GH actions to run tests on PRs
- Simplified Issue templates a bit
- Meetings, 1:1s, planning, licensing discussions

## This week's plan

### Pavish
- Implement routing on client (take over from server after intial page load)
- Table view using Svelte

### Ghislaine
- Learned enough from the wireframing process, we can go higher-fidelity
- Will work on creating UI for inventory use case in Figma
    - No design system yet, since it'll just slow things down
- User will be working with views
- Write down Mathesar principles to make decisions
    - Talk about how to close design issues

### Brent
- Writing tests for last week's functionality
- Types and type inference

### Kriti
- Update wiki, roadmap, usecases & concepts. Better documentation.
- Sync webapp and db tables
- GPL for Mathesar
- Update CSV import to save CSV file
- API for CSV import
    - One API for uploading CSV
    - One API for showing 10-20 lines of CSV
    - Status of CSV upload
    - API to actually create table
- If time permits, allow TSV import (to be co-ordinated with Brent)

## Community readiness check-in
- License
    - GPL
- Roadmap
    - Kriti to update wiki
- Tickets
    - Still a few weeks away from making publicly contributable tickets

## Other Discussion

### URL Routing
- Routes might need to be duplicated in both backend (Django URLs) and frontend, since we need to handle routing from both places depending on whether the user is already in the application

### Exposing DB Structure vs. Object View of Data
- Not mutually exclusive to expose DB structure and let people work in different views
- Discussion will continue async

### CSV Uploads & Type Inference
- Current workflow is to upload a CSV file directly, we want to change it to store the CSV file, show 20-30 lines to the user, infer types, allow users to change types, and then create the table.
    - Type inference should be in the database, not Python so the fastest way to infer is to make a table full of strings first.
- Type inference - public function signatures
    - Infer a type for a column
    - Infer types for columns of an entire table
    - Automated flow --> upon upload, show types to the user
- Discussion will continue async

### Closing Design Issues
- How to close design issues on GitHub? What needs to be done?
- Discussion will continue async

### Matrix-related Discussions
- Tech discussions should happen in the Mathesar public channel where possible.
- Set up a separate code review channel for PR review requests.
- Mittens says "miaow"
