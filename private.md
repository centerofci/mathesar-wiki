# What should be private?

Most information about Mathesar should be in the public section of this wiki (any section **other than** this one, `/private`). Things that should live here are:

- Raw user interview notes and videos
- Notes on competitors
- Notes on potential collaborations
- Notes on product strategy and publicity

Please add more things above if you think of any.
