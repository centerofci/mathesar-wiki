## Motivation
Most search engines and experiences have more-or-less the same user flow.  You
type general search terms, perhaps add some filters or other simple logic, then
view results ranked by their popularity, authority, and relevance to your
query.  This isn't the only way to discover things, however.  Perhaps you want
to find bands that inspired your favorite band, or bands they've inspired.
Maybe you want to find other restaurants owned by the chef who owns your
favorite fancy restaurant.  Etc.

## Questions
- What ways to folks find things in real life, and why are these missing (or
  deemphasized) online:
  - Find restaurants by wandering down the street.
  - Discover music through relations to previously-enjoyed music (not
    necessarily audibly detectable relations)
  - Find keys by retracing steps through the house.
  - Find keys on the keyboard by muscle memory.
  - Decide what to eat for dinner by checking the fridge for previously-cooked
    food, and ingredients.  Constrained by how much effort would be needed,
    perhaps fall back to ordering.

## Potential Users
- General

## Challenges
- Competition in search is stiff.
- Given how much effort is expended in search globally, it may be that missing
  methods are missing for good reason.
