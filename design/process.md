# Design Process

## Problem Framing
During this phase, we try to define the boundaries and context of the design problem by drawing connections between the current situation and the desired future state. Once we understand the gap that exists between these two, we can describe the design problem from the perspective of the user. We look at the problem from their perspective and consider what they need.

### Goals
Frame the design problems that need to be solved to implement the roadmap.

### Activities
- **Research:** practical research on the problem from literature, user testing with prototypes, user interviews, and product retrospectives.
- **Data Analysis:** learn more about the problem through analyzing qualitative and quantitative data.
- **Facilitated Discussion:**

### Questions
#### How do we know what the desired future state is?
The desired future state is defined by our product strategy and the desired functionality that it expects to deliver as captured in our [roadmap](/product/roadmap). The product strategy is the "big picture" that drives our work, and it helps us communicate what the product stands for, why it exists and where it should go.

#### What if the roadmap changes?
In a perfect world, we would build everything we outlined in our product roadmap. However, as we often learn the hard way, nobody has time to build everything in the roadmap. So we have to compromise and determine what we absolutely can build based on constraints like time and current team size.
When prioritizing, we select the features that will have the most significant impact on users or that we already know will require less effort for us to build.
To understand the user needs, we develop [use cases](/design/exploration/use-cases/overview). A use case scenario depicts how a user would use the product to solve a particular problem. We test these use cases against our current roadmap version. If the features fail to solve the user needs, we revisit them to add the missing parts or simplify the use case.

#### What are design problems?
Design problems are concerned with design aspects of the product that are lacking, unresolved, or otherwise preventing a desirable future state from being achieved.


## Define Point-of-view and Goals
During the point-of-view phase, we turn the problem into an actionable, goal-oriented statement. Actionable is key here, as we understand there's no "right" product feature or design solution; we have to decide which is best for the situation we're in. The point of view is essential for decision-making and helps us focus our energies to prioritize.
