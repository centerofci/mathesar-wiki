## Problem

Most popular modern social networks are heavily surveilled privacy nightmares.
They're prone to government and corporate censorship.  Their centralization
feeds the prior problems, and also creates a single point of failure for the
entire enterprise (if Twitter, Inc. goes under, so does Twitter the service)

## Solution

Decentralize it.  In a decentralized social network, users would be able to own
the data they produce, and would be able to choose with whom they communicate
and how.  Even better would be if it was a protocol more than a specific app.
That is, a reasonable protocol could attract multiple app developers to create
more tailored user experiences based on the same information source(s).

Note that this is beyond the federated social networks (think Mastodon).

## Challenges

- heavy competition
- spam
- privacy is difficult

## Thoughts

Other players in the space (that we're aware of):
- Mastodon
- bitmessage
- Twetch (not sure this is legit)
- LBRY

Some of these seem to be wedging blockchains in where they may not be
warranted.  Perhaps blockchain is useful for a directory, but it doesn't really
seem necessary for it to be globally-agreed upon.  For discovery, perhaps users
could subscribe to servers maintaining directories, and add other users to
their pull-list.  Basically usenet + bittorrent, I guess.
