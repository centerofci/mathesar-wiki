# Ryan Merkley meeting notes

**Date**: 2021-02-09  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Ryan

*No notes were taken during the meeting, these are high-level ideas recorded afterwards.*

## Personal Health Dashboard
- Ryan really liked this idea
- Similar to an idea that he was working on with someone else a while back, which was a general application that would give you insights based on data (not specific to health)
    - So much data is recorded about you all the time by your phone, apps, online activity, etc. but you don't benefit from any of it.
    - Collect all the data recorded by third parties about you and get insights from it.
- Instead of focusing on a niche that really needs this app (e.g. chronic pain sufferers), focus on something that appeals to a broad base of people but isn't critical to them
    - e.g. people with migraines really need them gone, if the app doesn't work for them, it will bring their quality of life down
    - example of a broad thing that many people could use:
        - analyze weather, humidity, etc. data as well as selfies on the user's phone to figure out whether they should wear a jacket that day (or pants instead of shorts)
        - if you get this wrong, it's not too bad
        - lots of people would like it, and the set of "humans who wear clothes and are in places with variable weather" is really large

## Easy DB
- Would the audience be people who don't currently use databases (like Ryan), or people that use databases but want them to be easier?

## Personalized Learning
- CC was planning to build a version of this before Ryan joined CC but the board didn't want to proceed with it
- A lot of people have been thinking about this, so talk to Cable Green and Dan Mills to build on what they were thinking
    - Cable wasn't hugely involved but would still have insights

## Research Collaboration
- Ryan seemed interested in this idea

## General Discussion
- Ryan is happy to schedule follow up conversations
