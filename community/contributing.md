We welcome contributions of all kinds to Mathesar!

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask. See the [Community](/community) page for how to find us.

# Code
Mathesar's development happens on [GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar). If you are not familiar with GitHub or pull requests, please follow [GitHub's "Hello World" guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) first.

You may also want to visit our [Engineering](/engineering) page to learn more about our development process.

## Finding an Issue
Find an issue to work on from our [issues page](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues).
  - Unassigned issues tagged `good first issue` or `help wanted` are especially tagged for contributors.

If you want to work on something for which there is no GitHub issue open yet, create an issue and propose your change there. A Mathesar maintainer will evaluate your issue and decide whether we'll accept a pull request for the issue. If we indicate that we will accept a PR, then go ahead and start work on it.

## Contributing
Once you've found an issue to work on, 

- Comment on it and say you're working on that issue. This is to avoid conflicts with others also working on the issue.
- A Mathesar team member will assign you to that issue.
- Write your code and submit your pull request. Be sure to read and follow our [code review guidelines](/engineering/code-review).
- Wait for code review and address any issues raised as soon as you can.

## Code Review
We encourage and appreciate code review by contributors. Feel free to review any open pull requests. Follow our [code review guidelines](/engineering/code-review).
