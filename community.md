Welcome to the Mathesar community! We'd love to have you involved in our project, as a contributor, a user or both!

You are welcome to participate in our [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions) and join us on [`#mathesar:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#mathesar:matrix.org) or our [other Matrix channels](https://matrix.to/#/+mathesar:matrix.org).

# Contributors
We are not yet ready for contributions from the public, but hope to be ready by mid-June 2021. We're working to finalize our initial architecture and designs and build up a backlog of issues to contribute to.

To learn more about our development workflow, see [the Engineering page](/engineering).

## Future Plans
Some ideas we're considering in the future to grow the contributor community:
- Setting up a developer mailing list.
- Setting up events, such as office hours, pair programming sessions, or even livestreaming our work.
- Participating in FOSS internships such as Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, CommunityBridge, etc.

Let us know if you have more ideas!

# Users
We are aiming to have an alpha version of Mathesar ready for users by fall 2021. If you'd like to be one of our alpha users, please join us on Matrix and let us know!

## Future Plans
Some ideas we're considering in the future to grow the user community:
- An end-user focused Matrix channel
- An end-user focused mailing list or forum (Discourse?)
- A way for users to vote on [Roadmap](/product/roadmap) items.

Let us know if you have more ideas!
