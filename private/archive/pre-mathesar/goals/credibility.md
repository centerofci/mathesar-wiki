# Use Open Information / Science to Enhance Credibility

## Motivation

It seems obvious that there is a (perceived) credibility problem in a number of
online spaces currently.  This leads to confusion and rampant disinformation,
as well as politicization of important topics (e.g., climate change).

## Questions

- Can open data, open science, and other open information help in this space?
  (It seems so)
- Can determination of credibility be mechanized? (dubious)

## Potentially interested parties

- Scientists
- Journalists
- Interested laypeople
- Politicians who need to justify policy

## Challenges

- Interested parties don't necessarily _want_ it to be easy to verify or
  challenge conclusions.
- This would potentially create chaos.  Success would look a bit like
  publishing a Luther bible (i.e., everyone gets to interpret for themselves,
  rather than leaving it to experts).
- Credibility of, e.g., a scientific data set, would imply (to this author)
  transparency throughout the process, since that allows public verification of
  the provenance and transformations of the data set.  This is likely to be
  distasteful to a number of researchers (no one likes publishing in-progress
  work).
