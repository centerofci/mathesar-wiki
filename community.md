## Matrix
We have a Matrix homeserver at `matrix.mathesar.org`, but you can join our public rooms using any Matrix account. If you haven't used Matrix before, we recommend getting started [using Element](https://element.io/get-started).

A list of our public rooms:

## GitHub Discussions

We use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions) for asynchronous conversations. Please introduce yourself in our [introductions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions/1) thread and don't hesitate to participate in or start a discussion.

# Future Plans
Some ideas we're considering in the future to grow the community:
- Setting up a developer mailing list.
- Setting up events, such as office hours, pair programming sessions, or even livestreaming our work.
- Participating in FOSS internships such as Google Summer of Code, Outreachy, CommunityBridge, etc.
- An end-user focused Matrix channel
- An end-user focused mailing list or forum (Discourse?)
- A way for users to vote on [Roadmap](/product/roadmap) items.

Let us know if you have more ideas!
