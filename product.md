# General Principles
We're following these principles while building Mathesar:
- Mathesar should be able to work as a frontend to existing databases without altering data, even if not all features are available.
- Mathesar is built in a modular way, so that:
	- Our database helper library should be able to be used independently of using Mathesar.
  - Mathesar's backend should support building custom frontend/mobile clients (all actions should be available via API, and should be well documented)
  - Mathesar should support plugins for custom data types, views, data manipulations, etc.
- Mathesar's frontend should have an intuitive, user-friendly, and delightful user interface.
