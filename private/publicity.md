Some rough thoughts on publicity for the MVP

- Reddit
	- /r/selfhosted
- Hacker News
	- Show HN
- Contact people who write about data tools
	- [Sharon Machlis](https://www.computerworld.com/author/Sharon-Machlis/)
- Create tutorials for specialized tasks via YouTube and blog posts
	- e.g. how to achieve 1NF (and so on)

## Description
A couple of ways we've described the project:
- Modern, open-source, version of Dabble DB
- Open source version of Airtable
- A product that helps users of all skill levels use, extend, and visualize their data.

None of these is satisfactory, we need to come up with something better than doesn't reference an existing product.
