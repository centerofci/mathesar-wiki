# Design Review Guidelines
## General Advice
- Describe the problem with the design but don't assume a specific design solution
- Strive to think from the user's perspective, not your own
- If you find inconsistencies in the design, describe what you expected to encounter instead
- Adapt your feedback to the design's fidelity level
    - e.g. pointing out alignment issues on wireframes is not useful because they are not meant to be high-fidelity
- Avoid ambiguity, try to articulate problems clearly and concisely
    - Use descriptive words such as "clear", "helpful", "obvious", "confusing", "complex", rather than "bad", "wrong", "off", etc.
- Think backwards from the end-goal
- Don't highlight only negative aspects of the design. Positive feedback provides valuable information.


## Review Process
Please follow these guidelines when reviewing designs.

### Authors
- Once you think a design is ready for review, post the design document and include all related resources such as wireframes, prototypes, etc. Be sure to include the specific feedback you are seeking.
- Specify an expected timeline for the review, if any.
- Please post in `#design-review:matrix.mathesar.org` and tag the Mathesar members with Product or Design roles (see [Team](/team) for handles). If the issue is related to implementation, tag the members with Engineering roles as well.
- If the reviewers request changes or have questions, please make the changes and re-request the review.
- Once everyone has had a chance to review (or the timeline expires) and you're satisfied with the feedback, update the document and summarize the decisions made.
- The author should push the final document to the wiki for implementation.

### Reviewers
- Check for outstanding design review requests at least once a day.
- Comment on the design document with feedback. Please follow the general advice above.
- Once you're done reviewing the document, post in the Matrix channel and say you're done reviewing.
- Specify explicitly if you want another look at the design spec before it is finalized.
- By sharing feedback, you actively participate in the UX process; make sure you read the context documents and are clear on the user's needs. If needed, ask questions, don't make assumptions.
