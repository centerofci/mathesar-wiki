# Adam Hyde brainstorming meeting

**Date**: 2021-01-28  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Adam

- General introductions
- Starting with a team rather than a project almost always leads to disastrous results
    - e.g. OLPC
    - Think about: What is the problem that's deep inside of us?

## General Advice
- Think about: what would the mission really be?
    - Don't rationalize a particular solution, it's really hard
    - Be really critical with each other
- Spend an afternoon on the mission and figure out where it leads
- Think about the services landscape around each idea that bring forward your expertise
- If you get to the point where you can build a framework that can be adjusted to different use cases, clients will give you a lot of money to adapt to a particular use case
    - Large clients will pay 200k for customized DB, better than chasing a lot of people paying 5k a month
- Is this something I've been thinking about a long time? Something that you can come to the table with and have an opinion about and people won't go "do these people know what they're talking about?"
- Bring what you're working on closer to you.

## Easy DB
- Data literacy for laypeople is a good in
- Project not emphasizing the tools, but the educational part of things, structured workshops etc.
- Work backwards from data literacy and find the best problem to solve, don't start with the technology itself
    - You might find that there's a better solution for the problem of data literacy
- You can probably get more momentum around the project if you focus on data literacy that you can't get for a particular set of functionality
- Sustainability: services, workshops at conferences and then later custom development services.
    - It takes a long time to get tools to the maturity where you can build a business around self-hosting, so ditch this idea
- Data literacy for scientists could be interesting
- Strength and weakness of technologists is that we tend to think in terms of technology
- Thinking about sustainability e.g. let's have a brainstorming session where we can't mention the top 5 ways that open source projects make money
- Open source projects do not need to make large amounts of money, relationships and revenue can build slowly
    - Workshops are small, but they are a good place to get started
        - Also puts you in contact with potential users and users, see them use the product, and see what mistakes they make

## Personal Health
- Not very familiar with this space
- Crowded space, crowded with startups with a lot of money, so much noise in the space
- Hard to know how to get above that
- Good argument for open source in crowded markets
- https://www.openhumans.org/ - not knowing about this means that you're not familiar with the space
- Adam entered the publishing space naively, but it's hard to architect a place in the market where you can get away with being naive and people that you're advocating a particular approach to are going "these guys don't understand all the history of what's already happened"

## Open Search
- Aim: visibility, transparency, credibility around science.
- Problems with preprints
    - Lots of material
    - visibility is difficult due to volume
    - determining credibilty difficult as well
- Connection is not clear with the search product
- We should consider co-design with people affected by this problem
- OER and OA space needs search
    - People are constantly asking for OER solutions, but can't find them
    - People can't find the solutions they need
    - There's space, need, and champions available there
        - Paul Allen institute
- Talk to some researchers, ask them about their process and start from there
- Most open access stuff is published as HTML, data embedded within it
    - Big driver within the industry to convert data to XML
    - Very expensive project, it makes publishing harder
    - Preprints are around because publishing takes a long time, XML is part of this
    - XML is mainly produced to make syndication easier
- Maybe talk to PLOS, PLOS has stopped producing XML because of the costs and lack of value
    - But there is value in cross-corpus search
    - Talk to other publishers
    - GETS General Article tagging scheme is the standard â€“ 4 varieties of it
    - Workflows built around XML first, this causes problems for non-technical people
    - Geeky "semantic" data has created a lot of costs
- Search portal is easy to understand, but secondary mission could be to get rid of XML
- Paul Allen Institute releases semantic data, Elsevier is releasing citation data
- Publishers have a lot of legacy thinking, so they might not agree that this is a space
    - Have the conversation in a more open ended way
    - Is XML part of your workflow? What do you use it for? Are you producing XML just for searchability or do you need that structure for anything else? How much does it cost? How much time does it take? What if you could just go somewhere and find that data, would that meet your needs?
- A lot of work might already been done with Paul Allen Institution and Elsevier data
    - And Unpaywalll

## Learning Management
- Very broad space
- So open ended that it's almost describing a domain
- P2PU - Philip Schmidt has tackled this
    - https://www.p2pu.org/en/
- Mozilla has tackled this
- We probably don't know enough about this domain, a lot of things are missing, a lot are sophisticated, a lot of them have failed, a lot of them have partially succeeded
- Doesn't feel like the right domain for this team since we're not familiar with this field
- Unless you know immediately what the gap is, it's probably not the right space. Finding a niche will take a long time and a lot of research.
