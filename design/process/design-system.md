### Ways to create library components
There's no single best approach when it comes to building components. Methods like fast-prototyping will sometimes require interfaces to use components before they become available in the library. 
In the book *Building Design Systems*, two different approaches to creating new components are described. Both methods of construction are outlined here:
- **Build Up Components to Create Interfaces:** Start with building the components and grouping them until the interface is complete.
- **Break Down Interfaces into Components:** Break an interface into parts until and start creating components for the reusable ones.

## Front-end Guidelines
