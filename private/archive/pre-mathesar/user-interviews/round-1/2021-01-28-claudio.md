# Claudio brainstorming notes

**Date**: 2021-01-28  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Claudio

- General catching up

- We need to clear up what we want to achieve
    - What do we want to fix about the world?
- Don't develop ideas first
- The existing mandate doesn't say anything about the values we want to have in the world
- Need to figure out whether we want to develop a "backend" or "frontend" solution
    - Major OSS that companies rely on are not maintained well or have little support, but that's all "backend"
        - There are a lot of opportunities there
        - "Backend" solutions are not catchy but may be more impactful in the open source community
    - "Frontend" solutions are focused on real world users, that's a different story
        - Competitors to "frontend" solutions are public sector.
        - Need to address: why should people use your stuff when there are SaaS solutions?
    - It's hard to mix backend and frontend
        - CC Search had that problem with the API and the frontend
        - API is hard to explain to people, your mom can use the frontend
- Journalism has been battling "fake news" for a while
    - Tech based fact checking tools, designed with a good heart but leading to bad outcomes (bad implementation)
    - They want to fix something that's real – disinformation/misinformation
        - Social media is built on misinformation
    - "We want to build a tool that makes journalists lives easier", theory of change is that telling people what is a fact and they will confront their own beliefs and change their mind.
        - But that doesn't happen.
        - People don't want to change their minds, they vote for Trump (for example) not because they care about facts
- Maybe there's a connection between getting rid of companies like Elsevier and our ideas
    - Can we support this movement / institutions / libraries into turning their repositories to something easier on the eye for lay researchers?
    - Open Search could make getting into Elsevier journals less incentivized
    - Tap into market of disaffected scientists unhappy with current system
        - e.g. free copy from arXiv, but prestige comes from the journal it's published in
    - We are to solve which papers are credible, what you "need to read"
        - Difficult to solve, but doesn't exist
        - COVID-19 – scientific papers coming out super fast, people need to decide if it's credible
- There's a lot of collectives right now around the world, developing tools for things are needed outside the commercial or corporate world
    - Activists, journalists, etc. need to use Signal instead of WhatsApp
    - Other more marginalized groups – e.g. RiseUp is providing email, mailing lists, VPN for underserved communities, especially privacy aligned
        - They found the need and they're doing it, even though they don't have the money to do
    - Maybe a project like this can support something like this that has been done for the corporate world
        - Find other marginalized groups and solve needs for them
- Federated repositories in Latin America funded by public funding:
