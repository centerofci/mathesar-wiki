Related to both [credibility](../goals/credibility), and
[accelerate knowledge, creativity, and innovation in the world](../goals/accelerate-innovation).

This is essentially the same as the
[Social network centered on source material](./source-commentary-ecosystem),
but aimed squarely at academics discussing preprints or recently published
scholarly articles.

## Problem

Discussion online of scholarly work generally happens in an ad-hoc way.  This
is verified by some interviews conducted by the team recently:
- [Jim Geelan](../user-interviews/round-2/2021-02-02-jim)
- [Karthik Dinakar](../user-interviews/round-2/2021-02-03-karthik)
In the interview with Jim, we discovered that his academic community was mostly
collaborating through a blog: [The Matroid Union](http://matroidunion.org/),
though pre-prints of papers are generally cross-posted to the
[arXiv](https://arxiv.org/).  From Karthik, on the other hand, we discovered that
pre-print medical papers are being posted on the
[medRχiv](https://www.medrxiv.org/), and then discussed on Twitter.  Neither of
these methods is optimal, and the ad-hoc nature would make entrance to and
participation in either community difficult.  This likely also adds friction to
interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Solution

Provide an easy-to use protocol and implementation of a PDF viewer alongside a
well-structured conversation platform.  The conversation platform should be
developed in collaboration with academics to ensure it meets the needs of
various communities.  Ideally, it would also be possible to add videos or other
media (e.g., conference talks could enhance the discussion).  It should be easy
to either integrate in something like medRχiv, or even a scholarly journal's
website.  It would be great if the protocol was set up so that a 3rd party site
could pull together different conversations (maybe even allowing
participation).  It should be possible to add conversations from, e.g.,
Twitter, into the conversation happening around the paper.

Another way to structure this could be starting with annotations first. See Samuel Klein's [Science Annotator proposal](https://notes.knowledgefutures.org/pub/annotator/release/3).

## Potential Users
- Researchers
  
Eventually, we might expand, but it would make sense to keep the focus tight at
first.

## Challenges

The ideal here would involve collaboration with already-existing sites where
scholarly articles and other academic works are hosted.
    
## Thoughts
- Ideas related to (or nearly identical to) this popped up independently in
  conversations with multiple users.

## Integration

This could integrate with both [Open Search](./open-search) and
[Article Checker](./article-checker) as entry points.
