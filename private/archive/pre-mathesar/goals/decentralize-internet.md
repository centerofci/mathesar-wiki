# Decentralize the Internet

## Motivation
Many people rely on managed third-party services for most of what they do on the internet. Video and music streaming, managed email, managed tasks, etc. This makes user data a commodity and leaves users dependent on the policies and whims of third parties. It would benefit society more if people owned their own data and services.

## Questions
- Where do we start? This is a huge problem to solve.

## Challenges
- People use managed services because they are easy to set up. Maintaining your own services is always going to be harder, even with the best UX.
