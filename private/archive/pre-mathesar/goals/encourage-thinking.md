## Motivation

Access to all the information in the world is useless if one lacks the mental
tools to properly utilize that information, or if one interacts with it only at
the most surface level.  Many current methods and structures that propagate
information on the internet seem to encourage a quick and thoughtless reaction.

## Questions

- Is it possible to create ways of finding and interacting with information
  (news stories, scientific articles, images, etc.) that encourage more
  thoughtful responses?
- Is there any particular advantage of open information in that space?

## Challenges
- The folks doing the thoughtless info consumption encouragement are quite
  professional at what they do.
  - In addition to thoughtless consumption and professionals feeding them, there are well-organized, "thoughtful" but destructive efforts motivated by "yucks," "fun," or nihilism who are difficult to stop because they feed off of attention and attempts to discredit them.
- Dopamine, which apparently comes along with the thoughtless reaction model,
  is quite addictive.
