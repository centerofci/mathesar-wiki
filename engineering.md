Mathesar engineering work happens on GitHub. We create GitHub issues to track everything we're working on.

- [Mathesar code](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar)
- [Mathesar GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions): we discuss and document architectural decisions here.
- [Active project on GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/projects/1): tasks we're currently working on
- [Backlog project](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/projects/2): tasks planned for the future. New issues end up here automatically for triage.

We try and keep our communication public. See:
- [Meeting Notes](/meeting-notes)
- [Community](/community)
