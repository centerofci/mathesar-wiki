# Development Process
Most of our work happens on GitHub. We create GitHub issues to track everything we're working on.

- [Mathesar code](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar)
- [Mathesar GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions): we discuss and document architectural decisions here.
- [Active project on GitHub](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/projects/1): tasks we're currently working on
- [Backlog project](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/projects/2): tasks planned for the future. New issues end up here automatically for triage.

We use Matrix for ephemeral conversation. You can find us on [`#mathesar:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#mathesar:matrix.org) or our [Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/+mathesar:matrix.org).

In addition, the Mathesar core team meets weekly to plan out work and does public daily standups asynchronously on Matrix on [`#mathesar-standup:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#mathesar-standup:matrix.org).
