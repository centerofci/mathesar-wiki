## Problem

A number of registries which need to be widely trusted and discoverable are
currently stored with a small number of closed institutions.  Examples are:
- Title registries.
- Copyright registries.

## Solution

Blockchains are distributed ledgers that require less trust of the parties
involved in transactions.  Taking openly licensed works as an example, a
registry could be created where one could register a given work, the license
the work is being distributed under, and creator info.  While this of course
doesn't prove actual ownership, it could be a verifiable demonstration of the
fact that a claimed creator had access to the work on a specified date (say,
before it showed up on some other website).  The nature of blockchain would
even potentially allow a creator to reference other works that inspired theirs.

## Challenges

- many "registries" are currently run by various governments, and would be
  difficult to oust.  This tool would, in those cases, be in parallel to the
  older systems.  This seems to create more problems than it solves.

## Thoughts

- This seems like a natural fit for a blockchain, but one must always ask:  Is
  a blockchain _actually_ necessary?
