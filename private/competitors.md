This is a list of our main competitors and how they're different from what we plan to do.

## Airtable
**Website**: https://airtable.com/

- Proprietary
- Cannot access underlying tables/data, except through REST API
- Focuses mainly on tabular, not natural exploration and manipulation of data
- Visualizations are limited
- Cannot do "smart" grouping of data
- Cannot add comments to records (at least Brent can't figure out how)
- UX issues:
	- Switching between bases takes too many operations
	- Cannot set default value for most fields (including multiple-choice fields)
	- Autocomplete on linked fields is annoying/distracting, the autocomplete fills up your screen and is slow.
	- Right-clicking a link in the browser is broken (doesn't allow copying links)

## Baserow
**Website**: https://baserow.io/

- Airtable clone, has similar limitations (but it's open source)
