# Welcome

Mathesar is an open source project that aims to make databases accessible to non-technical users, allowing users to store, manipulate, visualize, and collaborate with others on their data. We're heavily inspired by [Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY).

We are in early development and hope to launch an alpha version of Mathesar by fall 2021.

We work on GitHub:
- [Code](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar)
- [Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions)
- [Active project](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/projects/1) - tasks we're currently working on
- [Backlog project](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/projects/2) - tasks planned for the future

You can also chat with us on Matrix on [`#mathesar:matrix.org`](https://matrix.to/#/#mathesar:matrix.org) or join our [Matrix community](https://matrix.to/#/+mathesar:matrix.org).
