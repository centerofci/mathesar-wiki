There are five phases in our design process.

# Design Problem Framing
During this phase, we try to define the boundaries and context of the design problem by drawing connections between the current situation and the desired future state. Once we understand the gap that exists between these two, we can describe the design problem from the perspective of the user. We look at the problem from their perspective and consider what they need.

## Goals
Frame the design problems that need to be solved to implement the roadmap.

## Activities
- **Research:** practical research on the problem from literature review, user testing with prototypes, user interviews, and product feedback.
- **Data Analysis:** learn more about the problem through analyzing qualitative and quantitative data.
- **Facilitated Discussion:** foster a discussion to gain an understanding of the way each team member views the design problem.

## Questions
### How do we know what the desired future state is?
The desired future state is defined by our product strategy and the desired functionality that it expects to deliver as captured in our [roadmap](/product/roadmap). The product strategy is the "big picture" that drives our work, and it helps us communicate what the product stands for, why it exists and where it should go.

### What if the roadmap changes?
In a perfect world, we would build everything we outlined in our product roadmap. However, as we often learn the hard way, nobody has time to build everything in the roadmap at once. So we have to compromise and determine what we absolutely can build based on constraints like time and current team size.
When prioritizing, we select the features that will have the most significant impact on users or that we already know will require less effort for us to build.
To understand the user needs, we develop [use cases](/design/exploration/use-cases/overview). A use case scenario depicts how a user would use the product to solve a particular problem. We test these use cases against our current roadmap version. If the features fail to solve the user needs, we revisit them to add the missing parts or simplify the use case.

### What are design problems?
Design problems are concerned with design aspects of the product that are lacking, unresolved, or otherwise preventing a desirable future state from being achieved.

# Point-of-view, Goals and Constraints
During the point-of-view phase, we turn the problem into an actionable, goal-oriented statement. Actionable is key here, as we understand there's no "right" product feature or design solution; we have to decide which is best for the situation we're in. The point of view is essential for decision-making and helps us focus our energies to prioritize.

## Goals
Transform the framed problems into a set of goals and use those to kickstart the possibility exploration process. 

## Activities
- **Exploratory Wireframing**
- **User Journey Maps**
- **Storyboards**

# Explore Possibilities
During this phase, we explore the universe of possible design solutions and identify those that can potentially help us meet the goals we're trying to achieve. Design solutions don't have to be fully worked out to start the selection process.

## Goals
Explore the different ways in which a design problem can be solved 

## Activities
- **Possibility Definition** 
- **Define Selection Criteria**
- **Possibility Selection**

## Questions
### How are ideas selected?
We work towards selecting ideas in different ways, based on the implications of the decision being made. Some design solutions are critical for the product strategy, and others are less so. Identifying which ones are the most critical allows us define the criteria we're going to use during the final selection process.
### How do we balance methodology and creativity?
As is the case with most design projects, there isn't a single correct outcome. While methods, when applied properly, have a solid chance of leading to good results, creativity often trumps methodology when exploring the seemingly endless options and nuances of design ideas. From time to time, we need to sacrifice our methodology in order to stay open to new possibilities, loosen up, and embrace the chaos. The fewer constraints we put on ourselves during the ideation process, the more creative we can get.
