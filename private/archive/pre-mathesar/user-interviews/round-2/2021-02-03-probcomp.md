# MIT ProbComp meeting notes

**Date**: 2021-02-03  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Cameron Freer, Vikash Mansinghka, Zane Shelby, Ulli Schaechtle, Harish Tella

- Introductions
    - ProbComp has worked with child psychologists, NYT, citizen science to find industry applications for Inference QL
- Vikash presentation
    - Working on Common sense understanding -- human 18 months old 
    - Applications of technology:
        - 3D face modeling based on 2D image
        - Data cleaning based on domain expertise
            - uses PClean
        - Automated inference from data
            - Structure of the program can change, unlike with deep learning which only changes parameters
    - vs. Deep learning
        - learns from sparse messy data
        - users can add new data and questions in real time
    - MIT Inference Stack
        - Gen: general purpose platform (like tensorflow or pytorch, but broader)
- Inference QL presentation from Ulli
    - Inference QL replaces Bayes DB
    - Teaching material for Bayes DB is online
    - Can also share link to the demo for Inference QL
        - Teaching material will be released online over next few months
    - Bayes DB is no longer being maintained, CI failures will be fixed, but no migration to Python 3
