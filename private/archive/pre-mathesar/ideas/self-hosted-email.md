## Problem
There is no easy way to self-host your email. Most people rely on third-party services like GMail, which has a host of issues â€“ privacy, lack of ownership of user data, etc.

## Solution
Build a self-hosted email experience that is as simple to use as WordPress (which has one-click installs on many hosting providers such as Dreamhost).

This would involve figuring out how to configure an existing email server in a simple way and building a client for email that compares to GMail in terms of features.

## Challenges
- People depend on their email and we need this to be a seamless and bug-free experience in order to get their trust.
- We need an easy way to install security fixes for laypeople (similar to WordPress)
- There is a very active effort under the banner of security to make it very difficult to ge through the spam filters of services such as GMail. It's an interesting area with a movement of people trying to retain the ability to self-host, but currently getting the various certificates and other settings right is quite challenge if you want to avoid being flagged.
