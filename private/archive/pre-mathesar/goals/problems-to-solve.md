For now, everything is in one file. We should consider splitting into
different files later. Ideally, these should be focused, and phrased as
assertions (which we don't necessarily hold to be true)


- It's impossible or inconvenient to determine an appropriate learning path
  made of free materials for arbitrary subjects.
- Learning material resources often focus on only one learning style.
- There isn't enough support for small institutions or individuals to create
  and share curricula.
- It's impossible or inconvenient to find research materials.
  - This doesn't seem to be a problem from our current perspective, but we
    should check the assumption by asking potential users
- It's impossible or inconvenient to understand connections between different
  research materials.
  - This is more of a problem w.r.t. tool availability, but it may be that the
    task is less important or interesting.  We should check this assumption.
- It's impossible or inconvenient to determine the upstream dependencies or
  assumptions of an assertion
  - Related to previous.
- It's impossible or inconvenient to determine the credibility of a given
  scholarly work (or assertion within a scholarly work)
  - Has it been replicated?
  - Has it been retracted?
  - Do either of these hold for its dependencies?
  - How useful is the journal (if any) where the result appeared for
    determining the credibility?
  - Particularly difficult for a scholarly work which is not yet peer-reviewed
    (at least within the current academic paradigm).
- It's impossible or inconvenient to find a work which hasn't been replicated
  in a given scholarly field
  - Could be useful for graduate students or lower-in-the-hierarchy scientists,
    but I'm skeptical this is something folks are trying to do.
