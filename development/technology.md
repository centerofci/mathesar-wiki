# Stack
Mathesar is built using:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the data storage
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the backend
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to talk to the database
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the web application and API 
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) for the frontend

# Previous Discussion

## Frontend Stack
We considered these options for the frontend:
- A separate frontend codebase that consumes a JSON API generated by Django.
- Using "HTML over the wire" frameworks such as:
	- [Hotwire](https://hotwire.dev/) (Turbo + Stimulus)
		- [early stage integration with Django](https://github.com/hotwire-django/turbo-django)
		- [HN discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23330881)
	- [Sockpuppet](https://github.com/jonathan-s/django-sockpuppet)
	- [HTMX](https://htmx.org/)
	- [Django Unicorn](https://www.django-unicorn.com/)

> See ["Deciding the frontend framework" on GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions/55) for the final decision.

## Django Tenants

> `django-tenants` will not work for us because it uses schemas to separate tenants, and we support multiple schemas per user.
{.is-danger}

[Django-Tenants](https://django-tenants.readthedocs.io) is an app for Django-powered SaaS applications to have multiple tenants via PostgreSQL schemas. Currently, there is no built-in support for multitenancy in Django.

Django-Tenants [can identify tenants based on subdomins or subdirectories](https://django-tenants.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#sub-folder-support) and provides:
- shared common data and tenant-specific data
- tenant-specific routing

### Constraints
Requires the application to use
- Django as the framework
- PostgreSQL as the database

### Reading
- [Multi-tenant SaaS database tenancy patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-sql/database/saas-tenancy-app-design-patterns)
