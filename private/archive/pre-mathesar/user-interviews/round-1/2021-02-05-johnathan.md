# Johnathan Nightingale meeting notes

**Date**: 2021-02-05  
**Attendees**: Kriti, Brent, Johnathan

- Introductions
- Go over our ideas and process so far
    - Where are we in the process now?
    - Academic research and collaboration
    - Personalized Health Dashboard
    - Personalized Learning management system
    - Easy DB

## Questions

- Reactions to product ideas?
    - It's a really broad swath
        - Any one would be massive to take on
    - Which one do we have an unfair advantage on that?
    - Community
        - Network effect is a moat, and it works.
        - Moats can be shallow. e.g. Google Docs vs. Notion
        - The MVP here would be a community in Reddit or something like that, not a new software product
            - Building a community is the hard part
        - If I was Meta: find 20 top researchers, get recommendations, send them stuff they've never cited and try to get them to subscribe
        - Try to really surprise grad student or researchers, impress the professionals with something they didn't know before
    - Product/market fit
        - Mark Andreesen has really good advice on this
    - Mozilla
        - "like this but open source" doesn't work
        - Things turned around when a splinter cell decided to build a better IE instead of having a whole internet suite, went from 0.5 mil to 0.5 bil users
    - Want to find a place where Open Source has a natrual advantage
        - make it structurally hard for closed source to compete with you
        - Thinks this applies to Research collaboration tools
        - Thinks the dashboard is composed of walled gardens
    - Personal Health Dashboard
        - Thinks there's many startups doing that (likely)
        - Many different data streams
            - Difficult to collate
        - Keep it narrow;
            - We could be world experts in 6 months
            - Could find the relevant experts
        - Crypto-diseases where symptoms are in a spectrum and there could a lot of triggers
        - Building a data corpus using this tool would be useful, opt-in, privacy safeguards
        - Universities can pay for access to data (!!!)
        - Don't need AI, linear regression works
        - Toronto startup called dothealth sells consumer benefit to connect medical health in one place
            - Kaiser gives you some of it
    - Research collaboration
        - Meta, startup in Toronto bought by Chan-Zuckerberg
        - Solve problem of keeping up with your field, find opportunities for collaboration or not spend time on the same problem
    - Courseware
        - He's worried we'll get curb-stomped by a private company
        - Functionally creating a two sided marketplace
        - Company can scrape our data and then negotiate revshare agreements with providers
            - e.g. start an AirBnB competitor wouldn't work
        - Reach is hard to get
            - Wikipedia managed it, so it's possible but hard
        - Metapedia (Wikipedia competitor)
            - only let in experts
        - Pick a narrow slice first
            - Become the world expert - best place to learn thing X
            - Don't pick programming, too many people doing it
    - Easy DB
        - Go look at people doing no code stuff
        - Fall into two camps:
            - ones that are about a specific task
            - ones that are failing
        - VenMobi - create mobile apps for conferences with no code
        - you need to be 10 times better than Microsoft Excel, and that's hard
        - Airtable is differentiating with richer data
        - Projects near software will draw a lot of contributors, but they will not be the kind of contributor that knows what nontechnical users need
            - e.g. Photoshop vs. GIMP driven by design vs. engineering
        - Thinks that people who _want_ to make database software won't do well with building for non-programmers.
        - Pick a thing, make database to track X vertical
            - don't do recipes
            - not served by microsoft excel
            - well articulated set of needs
            - health information is one of those
- Ideas on structuring the first few months of work?
    - Need goals, tiny organizations often skip goals because we're small enough, we're aligned, but it's not good
        - What is a goal that matters by end of the year?
            - v1 out, 500 copies installed, doesn't actually mean anything
        - Talk to researchers, figure out what matters to them, and be grounded in something real
        - If researchers say racial diversity and age diversity might be useful, so we need 20,000 people
        - Where would we need to be by the end of 2021?
            - Where would we need to be by the end of June?
        - don't backload everything
    - goals: don't just say "grow revenue", focus on impact and what makes us proud to do things
    - put goals in front of advisory board and see if it's meaningful and if we can run with it
        - this is what we need from you
    - Try to divide things up; starting from goals for the year, and work backwards
        - 
- What pitfalls should we be looking out for?
    - Don't build something (again) that doesn't have monetization/self-sufficiency
    - Build something that matters to people, that's the first step 
    - Reid Hoffman has a phenomenal business brain and he will help you figure out how to take a valuable product and make it self-sustaining
    - Make it valuable first!
- Do you know anyone in these industries that would be good for us to talk to?
    - No one leaps to mind except people you already know
    - Meta (startup) founders
