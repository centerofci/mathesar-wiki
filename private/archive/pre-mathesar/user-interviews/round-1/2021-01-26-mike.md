# Mike Linksvayer brainstorming meeting

**Date**: 2021-01-26  
**Attendees**: Brent, Kriti, Mike Linksvayer

## Preamble
- How did we end up here?

## EasyDB
- Don't know the space very well
- Seems like an educational mission
    - needs an analysis of how to get users involved
- Depending on use case, it may be already covered by more specialized (google forms)
- "No code" seems to be getting another bump, is there an open source version of those solution?
    - Salesforce has a business around making data accessible to businesspeople
- Maybe useful in situations with a team where not _everyone_ has DBA experience
- There are a huge number of personal knowledge/inventory products around

## Personal Health
- Don't know the space very well
- Very viable, very difficult
- Why no competitor offering what we're thinking?
    - Not sure
    - Maybe the problem of storing health data
- Quantified self movement
- Would be impactful

## Open Search
- Microsoft Academic Graph - Google Scholar competitor (more reading needed)
    - Advantage: maybe gets Chinese authors and Chinese papers better?
- https://scholia.toolforge.org/ - Wikidata UI, no marketing behind it
- Mike is a huge fan of Wikidata, it's like an iceberg but it will get more useful.
    - Danny? has rejoined Wikipedia to make Wikidata more useful
- would be good to exploit and contribute to Wikidata
- Is open really an advantage here?
- Maybe focus more on the bleeding edge rather than stuff that's already gone through journal process
- Look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altmetrics for credibility
- Reputation is woefully underexplored
    - Peer review is done by grad students usually, not some storied professor
    - Not a recipe for quality
- Altmetrics alt terms
    - Overlay journal (review after publication)
- Encourage alternatives to current mode of academic success - publish
    - Encourage replication of results, rather than new ideas
    - Encourage funding person or lab, not the project
        - New ideas being figured out are blocked by how credit is assigned to research
- Very hard to institutionalize solutions to this issue
- Is building out a new search engine really the solution here?
    - Wikidata exists
- Intersection between people who use personal knowledge management/wiki tools and researchers
    - Mendeley
    - Zotero

## Personal Learning Management
- I like the audacious long term vision
- Not a space I'm aware of
- Big adoption challenge
    - Limited set of hardcore self-learners who want to follow a learning path without credentials
- There are curated lists online
    - GitHub lists of courses about hot topics like machine learning
    - AMA's mathematics autodidact guide
- Getting a critical mass of people to use and invest in your platform sounds challenging
- Long term: certifications could be a thing
    - Everybody who has had an education idea outside of official education system wants to do this
    - Should talk to Cable about this
- Talk to Jane Park about P2PU/peer learning, maybe?
- Resources are hard to find sometimes (e.g. graph minor theory course)
- Well past the moment for targeting kids learning remotely

## Final Discussion
- Personal learning seems least promising, edtech is crowded, but also not familiar with the space
- EasyDB second least promising, nobody offering this but crowded field, people figuring out data problems is what computers are all about and finding a niche would be difficult.
- Personal Health Dashboard first, doesn't seem like it exists, potentially impactful, maybe Mike would use it although he's lazy
    - Don't know space well
- Open Search: if modified to be reputation intervention with or without search, would be very excited about that
    - Probably have a good network already from CC
