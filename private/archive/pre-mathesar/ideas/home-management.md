## Problem
Every family deals with a common set of problems when managing their home.
- Regular cleaning and maintenance (from daily vacuuming to biannual gutter cleaning)
- Making food (inventory, figuring out what to make, grocery shopping)
- Entertainment (movies, TV, music)
- Budgeting
- Managing schedules
- Paying bills

## Solution
A self-hosted suite of tools that solves each of these problems that integrate with each other or via APIs with third-party tools.
- Task management
- Food management (see [Food Inventory and Recipe Search Engine](./recipe-search))
- Money management
- Shared calendar
â€“ Media server

## Challenges
- This is a huge project, although we could look into reusing existing open source software for portions of this.
- In order to be accessible to laypeople, this has to be really, really simple to set up.

## Additional Thoughts
- We could offer support as a service for financial sustainability.
