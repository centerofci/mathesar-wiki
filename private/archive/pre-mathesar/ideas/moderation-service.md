## Problem
Every service accepting user generated content has its own moderation policies and moderation decisions are not transparent. Moderation policies are also controversial, with large sections of the populace believing that major platforms moderate based on political bias.

## Solution
Provide "moderation as a service", where policies can be transparently stated and moderation discussions and decisions are openly available and have public appeals. The only goal of the service is open and transparent moderation, and it can provide APIs to integrate with other platforms.

## Thoughts
- This would give us the chance to change norms around moderation and have a recommended moderation policy (e.g. you can say anything you want as long as you're not making ad hominem attacks)

## Challenges
- Would anyone use this service? Companies moderate heavily because it affects their bottom line, would they want to make it more open?
