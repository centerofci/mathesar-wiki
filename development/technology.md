Mathesar is built using:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the data storage
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) for the backend
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) to talk to the database
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the web application.

We have not decided on a frontend stack yet.
