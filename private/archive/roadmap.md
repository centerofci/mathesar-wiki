This is a list of features that we anticipate having in the MVP. Please see [Features](./features.md) for a full list of potential features for the product.

# Phase 0: MVP
The MVP will focus on a basic set of features that are useful to a broad base of users and that we can ship quickly. On a high level, we will focus on:
- Tabular data
- Individual users
- Schema changes within tabular data
	- e.g. move a column from one collection to another, turn a column into another collection
- Aggregations and derived column types
- Basic visualizations
- Common column type types only
- Common import types only
- Export data

The following features will be added after the MVP ships, unless user interviews turn say otherwise:
- Suggested schema improvements
- Suggested aggregations
- Suggested visualizations
- Freeform collections (JSON column types)
- Teams and organizations
- Public data sharing
- Integrations with external tools
- REST API
- Additional column type types
- Additional import types
- Additional export types
- Form views
- Advanced visualizations
- Third-party user login
- Application Templates
- Versioning
- Undo/redo
- Monetization
