# Introduction

This version of the roadmap is only for the alpha/minimum viable product (MVP) version of Mathesar, expected to ship fall 2021. Our plan is to build all the features required for a user for a very simple use case. Once we've shipped that, we will then expand the roadmap based on user feedback and enabling more complex use cases.

The initial use case we've chosen is a user creating and maintaining a basic inventory of their media collection using Mathesar. Please see the following design documents for more information:
- [Inventory Use Case exploratory document](/design/exploration/use-cases/inventory-use-case)
- [Inventory: Data Exploration exploratory document](/design/exploration/inventory-data-exploration)
- [Inventory Use Case report/conclusions](/design/reports/inventory-use-case)

The roadmap below reflects the features needed to create a good user experience for this use case, while following our general [product principles](/product).

# Roadmap
Our roadmap is tracked via [GitHub milestones](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open).

# Future Features
> Please see [Feature Ideas](/product/feature-ideas) for a long and disorganized list of feature ideas that we're drawing from to create this roadmap.
