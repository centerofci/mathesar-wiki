# Ryan Kellogg meeting notes

**Date**: 2021-02-16  
**Attendees**: Ryan, Kriti, Brent

- There exist apps for letting people collect their data about health
- Thinks that there's space for APIs that work with these apps, and connecting them
- Seems to think starting with APIs, then adding a web (or app) client makes sense
- The challenge around predicting
    - What sort of model type is relevant?
    - What sort of features?
- Don't make the user plot things, just get data from them and push a button to analyze triggers, etc.
    - Triggers could be complex - sequences of events rather than individual events are often triggers
- Both population data aggregation and individual baselines are useful for predictions
- Ryan's work involves inflammatory diseases that have flareups or relapses
    - relies on molecular data from blood
- Simplest way to start is allow users to annotate data
    - I had migraines on X and Y days
    - After 10 migraines, figure out what was unique about those days
- Ryan would make use of the APIs as a researcher and biohacker
    - Thinks that the size of the number of users interested is small
- Ryan thinks that we'll need to focus on laypeople users
- Fitbit / Apple Watch data isn't as useful _until_ it's labeled
- Allowing users to get insights from data without giving to 3rd parties is powerful/important
- Need to think about first set of target users
    - Needs to be useful out of the gate
- Talked about other ideas
    - EasyDB: need to separate temporal data like sensor data from categorical data
    - Easy DB and Health Dashboard are connected
- Making it easy to collect data is a challenge
    - automatic is easier
- Sustainability of data collection
    - Needs to be "sticky"
    - Needs to have real benefits to the user
        - They need to have a limited time frame to focus on recording
        - Maintaining engagement over the long run is a challenge for anything digital health, wearables as well as app
- Of the wearables the Oura ring does the best
    - Their app keeps people engaged
    - The presentation / experience is superior to FitBit
- Use yes/no questions, long presses on iOS notifications, emojis, etc. to simplify health data gathering
- Ryan's day-to-day
    - Crash Course study
        - Fatigue
        - Using Qualtrics (surveys)
    - Has a company around collecting molecular / sensor data
        - RTHM (Real Time Health Monitoring)
- One goal could be reducing reliance on questionaires
    - We could tell them they look tired in their selfies
    - Eye-tracking task to assess mental state
- Where to start:
    - Integrate with existant devices
    - Open Humans
- Ryan can introduce us to the Open Humans folks
