# Accelerate Knowledge, Creativity, and Innovation

## Motivation
It's important for society to keep producing new art, science, and knowledge in order to better itself. We'd like to accelerate that process and reduce legal and logistical barriers that block creation.

## Questions
- What barriers currently exist that block new art, science, and knowledge from being created?
- Can these barriers be solved through better software?

## Potential Users
- Scientists
- Creators (artists, authors, etc.)
- Educators
- Journalists
- Students

## Challenges
- This is a huge problem to solve and there are probably many ways of solving it, we need to figure out where to start.
- The assumption that technology can solve this problem is untested.
