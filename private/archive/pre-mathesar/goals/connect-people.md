## Motivation

Social media seems to cause more harm than good. It would be great have a new way of connecting people in positive ways while avoiding the unhealthy consequences.

## Questions

- Is it possible to have social media that's done well, or is there

## Thoughts
- I think IM was a great way of connecting people because it simulated real-life better. In real life, you talk to one person at a time or maybe a small group â€“ you don't announce things to a large group of people. See [If People Left Parties Like They Leave Facebook (video)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mGcHNnI2mh4) for an amusing illustration.
- Games as a genre and MMORPGs specificially have experimiented with a variety of ways to connect people with much richer dynamics than most social media. Probably worth reviewing scholarship in this space.
- There are many online communities and scholars who have studied online communities. This is a relatively old field with a fair amount of very interesting ideas. There are a few very interesting community types.
  - Peer learning communities
  - Generative games such as Minecraft
  - Virtual communities see [The Virtual Community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virtual_Community) by Howard Rheingold
