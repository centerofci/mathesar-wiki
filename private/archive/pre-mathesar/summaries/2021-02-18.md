[Simple Databases for Everyone](dabble.md) is currently our top idea for the following reasons:  
- it has many different use cases and potential users
- it's relatively easy to prototype
- building this tool will allow us to build the foundation for some of our other ideas, should we want to pivot, such as:
	- [Open Health Dashboard](open-health-dashboard.md)
	- [GitHub for Data](github-for-data.md)
	- [Automated Data Scraper for the masses](auto-data-scraper.md)
- an integration with IQL or ProbComp's other tools would be a natural extension, and would allow us to have features that no one else has
- the current team's expertise is in software engineering (and not in health or education)

Next steps are to design the MVP, both in terms of features and technical specs. These will be documented in the [MVP](mvp/README.md) folder.
